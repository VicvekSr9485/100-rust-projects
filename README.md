# 100 Days of 100 Rust Projects

Welcome to my journey of building **100 Rust projects in 100 days** â€” a personal challenge to master Rust and demonstrate real-world problem solving with code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- Build one Rust project per day for 100 days
- Explore key concepts: ownership, lifetimes, concurrency, async, systems programming, and more
- Showcase practical Rust skills through CLI tools, web servers, utilities, and libraries
